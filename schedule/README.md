### Self Learning #1

Before you start with the self-learning portion of the workshop, please check that **you are logged into O2** and **are working on a compute node** (i.e. your command prompt should have the word `compute` in it).

> If you are not logged into O2 or are not on a compute node, please follow the steps below as appropriate before you start with the self-learning lessons:
> 1. Log in using `ssh rc_trainingXX@o2.hms.harvard.edu` and enter your password (HMSXXcluster) (replace the "XX" in both the username and the password with the number you were assigned in class). 
> 2. Once you are on the login node, use `srun --pty -p interactive -t 0-2:00 --mem 1G /bin/bash` to get on a compute node.
> 3. Proceed to the next section once your command prompt has the word `compute` in it.
